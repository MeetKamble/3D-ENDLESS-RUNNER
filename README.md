# 3D-ENDLESS-RUNNER
3D Endless Runner made in Unity. This is my first big project in Unity so I would appreciate any and all feedback, THANKS.

An Endless runner with various Obstacles generated at random and a coin system, with Animations, Audio and various 3D Models. Memory management is done by instantiating only 4 sections at once and destroying the unused sections.

CONTROLS:
"A" for LEFT and "D" for RIGHT OR "LEFT ARROW" for LEFT and "RIGHT ARROW" for RIGHT OR "PRESS/CLICK THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN" for LEFT and "PRESS/CLICK THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN" for RIGHT
